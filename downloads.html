      <ol class="px-5">
        <li>
          From Version 3.0 onward, different Levels/Editions of the software have been merged into one setup file, so you only need to download the above setup file for a full-featured trial. If you
          purchase a certain license level/module of the software, a corresponding softkey will be provided to you after your software registration. If you subsequently purchase an upgrade, then a new
          softkey will be provided to you. You do not have to change anything else.
        </li>
        <li>
          In additional to the softkey, one USB hardkey can be purchased per each license of the software optionally. The hardkey will be initialized to the software license level you have purchased.
          If you subsequently purchase an upgrade, then an upgrade package file will be sent to you to re-initialize that hardkey remotely. You do not have to change anything else.
        </li>
        <li>
          For hardware activated licenses, such as the licenses with VT DSOs. If you subsequently purchase an upgrade, then an upgrade package file will be sent to you to upgrade the license
          information embedded in that hardware remotely. You do not have to change anything else.
