      <p class="body__p">
        After successful installation of the software, you should run it in order to obtain the Site code and MID (Machine ID) values for your computer. We need these codes to calculate the Activation
        Code (softkey) for you. When you launch the trial software, an activation dialog box will pop-up. The Site Code and MID of your computer will be displayed in this dialog box.
