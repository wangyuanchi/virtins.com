      <p class="body__p">
        Software upgrade for the same license level is always FREE, moreover, you do not need to apply for a new activation code again (unless otherwise stated explicitly with the new version/build).
        Same for the case of hardkeys and hardware. When a new version/build is available online, just uninstall your current version, and download and install the new version/build, the software will
        be automatically activated to the level you own.

                This new version contains a new hardware driver for VT DSOs. If you have installed a previous VT DSO driver, then it is recommended to update it with the new driver in order to support
                USB1.1 full speed in additional to USB2.0 high speed. The steps are described as follows:

                  "Uninstall". On the Confirm Device Removal dialog box, click the Delete the driver software for this device option to delete the driver package that was used for the device.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Replug the VT DSO, under [Universal Serial Bus Controllers], right click [Virtins USB3.0 BootLoader VTDAQX_X], and select "Uninstall". On the Confirm Device Removal dialog box, click
                  the Delete the driver software for this device option to delete the driver package that was used for the device.
                </li>
                <li>Replug the VT DSO again, now you should see a "Unknown Device" under "Other Devices" in the Device Manager. Otherwise, repeat (1) and / or (2).</li>
                <li>Go to folder: C:\Windows\System32\drivers and delete file VTUSB3.sys. Go to folder: C:\Windows\System32 and delete folder VTDAQX_X.</li>
                <li>Right click "Unknown Device" in (3) and select "Update Driver Software...". The driver can be found at Multi-Instrument's root directory\Drivers\VTUSB3\32bit or 64bit.</li>
