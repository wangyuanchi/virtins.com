      <p class="body__p">
        Virtins Technology was established in 2004, specializing in PC-based virtual test and measurement instruments as well as control systems. We have quickly gained our reputation since the launch
        of our first product - Multi-Instrument, a PC based multi-function virtual instrument software. Multi-Instrument has been installed on hundreds of thousands of computers all over the world due
        to its support for sound cards, the very basic ADC and DAC device in almost every computer, as well as its try-before-you-buy feature. Powered by Multi-Instrument, our subsequent virtual
        instrument products, such as real time audio analyzers, oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, signal generators, data loggers, dynamic signal analyzers, have been well- recognized worldwide for
        their versatile functionality, high performance and quality as well as user-friendly operability. Our products have been used in many applications covering a wide range of industries. We are
        proud that MIT, Stanford Univ., Penn. State Univ., North Illinois Univ., Boeing, Los Alamos National Lab, Dolby Lab, Logitech, GE (China) R&D Center, Thales Group, Lockheed Martin Unmanned
        Integrated Systems, Tsinghua Univ., Agilent (China), and many other global R&D-intensive agencies and companies use our products. We also provide custom software and hardware design and
        development to suit the specific needs of various industries.
